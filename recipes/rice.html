    <h2>How to cook rice</h2>
    <p>Rice is the grain that feeds the world. Here's how to cook it perfectly every time.</p>
    <p>There are many varieties of rice: white rice, brown rice, short-grain rice, long-grain rice;
         and different ways to cook rice: stovetop, rice cooker, multi-cooker (Instant Pot), microwave,
          and oven-baked. Here's an overview of the many different varieties of rice you can buy, 
          along with tips for how to cook different kinds of rice so it turns out perfectly every time.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your favourite rice</li>
        <li>Sault</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To cook long-grained white rice on the stove, use a 2 to 1 water to rice ratio.
            Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.
            You can add an optional pinch of salt if you wish. Add 1 cup of rice, stir 
            briefly to break up clumps of rice, cover the pot with the lid, and reduce
            the heat to its lowest setting to help the rice cook evenly. If the temperature
            is too high, the bottom of the pan of rice can scorch while the rice at the top is still undercooked.</li>
        <li> Set a timer for 20 minutes. A little steam will escape the covered pot while the 
            rice cooks, this is normal. Resist the temptation to lift the lid and peek before 
            the timer runs out, otherwise too much moisture will escape and your rice will be too dry.</li>
        <li>When the timer rings, turn off the burner and remove the pan from the heat.
            Let the rice sit, covered, for an additional five minutes. No peeking! Let 
            the steam finish doing its work to plump and cook the rice.</li>
        <li>After five minutes, remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.</li>
    </ol>
